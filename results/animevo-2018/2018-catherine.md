- The first stage is decided by a strikes/bans system.
    - Players take turns striking stages starting with the orange sheep until 2 stages remain.
    - At this point, it will be orange sheep's turn to ban, this player then chooses a stage.
- From game 2 onward, the loser of the previous game will choose the stage.
- Players may not choose a stage that they have previously won on in that set. This is commonly known as "Dave's Stupid Rule" in the Smash community.
