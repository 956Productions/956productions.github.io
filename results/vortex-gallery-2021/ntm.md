## Tournament Rules

- Random Select on Stages (Hold down C then press A on course select screen).
- Do Not Skip the map in-between courses. If you skip a map you must give up the hole unless both players agree to not enact this.
- Avoid using coin or sending messages in chat when your opponent is taking their shot.
- In the case of a crash, desync or soft-reset:
    - If the crash happens in the first 3 holes of a match, restart the match and ignore previous scores.
    - Otherwise, the match will be restarted on the same course retaining the current scoreboard. The first 3 holes of the match will not count for scoring, and the remaining holes will apply. This means that if you crash on hole 10, hole 4 on the restarted match becomes the new hole 10, hole 5 is the new hole 11, etc.
- Players are encouraged to use [bigtournament.golf](https://bigtournament.golf/) to keep track of their scorecard outside of the game for visibility and for a backup in a crash situation.
