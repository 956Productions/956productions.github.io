## Tournament Rules

- BURNING WASTELAND Stage is banned.
- GIANT characters are legal, but there is a counter pick rule in place:
    - If a player chooses to pick a giant character, they must notify their opponent so they can choose their characters first (giants players cannot ask for blind pick).
    - If the giant player loses & wishes to switch characters, they must notify their opponent first, at which point the winner may **also** change their characters if they wish.
