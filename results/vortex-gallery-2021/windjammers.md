## Tournament Rules

- Game Settings: 99sec, 12 points, 2 rounds.
- Beach for first stage.
- Loser can counter-pick character and stage.
- No character counter-pick for the winner. 
- “Super Sudden Death” - In the event of a tie after the sudden death period, both players will re-select the same characters and stage, and the first to score will be the winner of that round. 
- “Dave’s Stupid Rule” - loser cannot counter-pick a stage on which they have already won a game during the current match.  The “banned” stages in this case are reset upon a bracket reset in Grand Finals. 
- Characters can be reselected on a bracket reset in Grand Finals.
- If the rare [round-breaking bug](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oOi9-SgAiA) where points score automatically until the round is over) occurs, the round only (and not the match) must be replayed.
