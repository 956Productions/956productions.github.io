## North America Tournament Rules

- For off-stream matches: if there is disagreement in the results of a match and you require any of these rules to be enforced **you must send a video of the matches to our TO’s** including the lobby screen to show proof of the players. **The video must be sent before your next match is called.** Otherwise the set must be played again while discord streaming to a TO.
- If your match is to be streamed a TO will request one or both players to join the Discord voice channel and use the Discord streaming feature to broadcast their gameplay.
- Before the match, both players may wait in the lobby and monitor the ping and report large fluctuations to a TO. TO’s will then invite the accused wifi user to a lobby and confirm before issuing a disqualification. Repeated false reports lead to accuser’s disqualification.
- External macros are not allowed - using button binds within the game options is allowed.
- If either player has a side preference, a coin must be flipped to determine sides ([justflipacoin.com](https://justflipacoin.com)).
- Use of Enja speed up glitch (4123632141236ABD) forfeits the game.
- Use of Shizumaru start button glitch for Shin Amanagare Kyourakuzan forfeits the game.
- Use of Coin glitch to disable inputs forfeits the game.
