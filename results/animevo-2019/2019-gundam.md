## Tournament Rules

- Winning Team must keep suits and Burst type, Losing Team may switch.

### Stage (Pools): Agreement or Random

- If opposing teams can come to an agreement on a single map, that stage will be set for their match. Otherwise, the stage will be set to Random Stage.
- Players have an enforced max of 60 seconds during match preparation to come to an agreement, or they may report the agreed stage at any time before match has been called.
- Pools will be using the "3 Out" system (1 Player on Winner's side & 2 from Loser's). Please [read this](https://combobreaker.org/3-out-pools/) for more information.

### Stage (Top 8): Pick/Ban

- A helper app developed by [@LukewarmHoliday](https://twitter.com/LukewarmHoliday) operating on a tablet will be provided on-site to facilitate this process.
- Each team alternates picking or banning stages from the pool of all remaining stages in the following order:
    - Team 1 Bans.
    - Team 2 Bans.
    - Team 2 Picks.
    - Team 1 Picks.
    - Team 2 Picks.
    - Team 1 Picks.
- \[for WF/LF/GF there is an additional round\]:
    - Team 2 Picks.
    - Team 1 Picks.
- The final pair of picks will have one of the two randomly discarded, resulting in three (or 5) unique stages. The order is fixed according to the order they were picked in. (In this example, Team 1's first pick is the first stage, followed by Team 2's first pick).
