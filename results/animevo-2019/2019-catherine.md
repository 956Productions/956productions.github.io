### Stage Selection

- The following stages are legal:
    - The Cathedral.
    - Clock Tower.
    - Quadrangle.
    - Spiral Corridor.
    - Torture Chamber.
    - Underground Cemetery.
- The following stages are counter-pick only:
    - The Empireo.
- The following stages are banned:
    - Inquisition.
    - Prison of Despair.
- Players will Rock-Paper-Scissor (RPS) and the winner gets to determine port (Player 1 Blue sheep and Player 2 being Orange sheep).
- The first stage is determined by alternating singular strikes of legal, non-counterpick stages starting with whoever is Orange sheep (Player 2) until there is one stage left.
- From game 2 onward, the loser of the previous game will choose the stage. Before a stage is chosen as a counter pick, in a best of 3 the winner of the previous game will strike two stages and then the loser will select from the remaining. In a best of 5, there is only one stage strike from the winner before a selection is made. These strikes before counter picks do not carry over between games.
- Players may not choose a stage that they have previously won on in that set, unless agreed upon by both players. This is commonly known as "Dave's Stupid Rule" in the Smash community.
