## Webcam Etiquette

- Test your setup in advance to check for glare.
- All of your zones must be visible by your webcam.
- When shuffling your deck, keep your hands in sight of the webcam. Failure to do so can lead to a caution that will be carried with you through the whole event. (2 cautions due to same rule violation will lead to a game loss).
- After shuffling your deck, you must cut your deck into 3 separate piles, and let your opponent choose the order it is stacked.
