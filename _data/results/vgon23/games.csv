This tournament will be hosted on Cloud VMs in Iowa accessed via Parsec. This will be more like an offline tournament, in that there will be several Stations and you will be called to them by a TO. Your station should also be listed on the start.gg bracket.  

*Before the tournament, send a Parsec friend request to* nycalibur
#4196856
  
Please read the Parsec [Player's Guide!](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vT4_VGwKBtt9l4ajXc1tGrcVvj5gprCwPGwAxARjky2RUzXFBAuayT4vL3UESz5BTTHCZmLrzYXF6w2/pub)  
  
You must wait for a TO to tell you to play your match, no matter where you are in the bracket.  
  
You must pay close attention to which station you are called to! Connecting to the wrong station or any interruption of another match can result in you being DQ’d from the tournament!!! So do not connect to any server unless told to.  
  
**Match Rules**  
During a Match Set, the winner of a Match must comply with the following “Winner Lock Rules”:  
 1. during the first Match Set, each Player selects their character
    and the stage is selected at random;   
 2. after a Match, the winner is ""locked"" into their character and they are not permitted to switch their character until/unless they lose a subsequent Match;
 3. a loser of a Match may rematch with the current characters and
    stage, rematch with the current characters and a new random stage,
    or return to character select to choose a new character and new
    random stage.
  
**Player Options**  
Prior to commencement of a Match Set, Players may exercise the following options:  
 - Side Selection. Players may mutually agree who plays as Player 1
   side or Player 2 side at the start of a Match Set. If Players cannot
   agree on this, they will play a Best-of-One Rock-Paper-Scissors to
   determine who will pick their preference first. Players will play out
   the entirety of the Match Set with this selection. 
  - Blind Pick. Players may request a Blind Pick for character selection. “Blind Pick” means that, prior to the first Match, Players will each tell a Tournament Organizer staff member, in secret, their characters selection for the first Match. Players will then select their characters with the Tournament Organizer staff member validating their selections. If a Player purposely does not select the character they told the Tournament Organizer staff member, that Player will forfeit the Match.  
- Button Check. Players may request to do a “button check” to check the proper functionality of their controller with a test match before the official start of a Match Set.  
  
  
**Double K.O.**  
In the event of a tied Match declared by a Double K.O. on the Game screen, the Match will not be scored and both Players will replay the tied Match with the same character selections.  
  
During Grand Finals, if the Player in the Loser's bracket wins, it sends the Player in Winners Bracket to Losers, triggering a ""Reset"". This Reset Match is considered a new Match for all intents and purposes, including Winner character choice lock and stage randomization.  
  
**Button Binds**  
Sequence mapping is banned. A Player may not program functions on a controller using methods outside the basic functions of the Game, including, but not limited to, programmable and turbo controllers.  ",Parsec,2023-02-11 12:00pm,2023-02-11 12:00pm,PST,-8,PC-Parsec

Splatoon 3 has a feature where private battles may be ended early by anyone in the room. You can do this by holding ZL, ZR, L, R, right stick, and left stick for 3 seconds. This will stop the match mid-game.

You may do this only if the rules permit it, this includes:
Valid disconnects 
Your match was started on the wrong map/mode by mistake.
Canceling a battle for any reason not stated in the rules will result in you losing the match or be handled at the staff's discretion.
This is not a rage quit feature, abusing this feature will get your team disqualified.
If your match is streamed by staff, only the streamer may cancel a private battle.
