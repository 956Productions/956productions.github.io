What the hell!? Punk...
For some reason, people seem to think that if I'm still alive, it'll cause political problems.
Obsession is also a form of love. What is this world coming to? Or is this the latest fad?
The rusty cogs will begin to move once more. 
To think I'd have to pull out all the stops against a total scrub...
The story will be revealed...maybe.
Almost... It has almost started. And you cannot stop it.
Be one of my people and I shall grant you my love.
The wheel of fate is turning...
Your movements are all in accordance with my assumptions.
Find me!
This is the untainted Country of Dreams!
You still consider a fight as intense as this a game...
I can't go back just yet. I have to complete my mission...
My heart grows sick every day I'm away from my wife...
I just keep punching until I hit something.
You should pay attention!
I just can't get enough... I never feel satisfied!
I thought you would amuse me... Guess I was wrong!
Good to see you guys again.
There will definitely come a time when your strength is required.
This is a fighting game!
A battle is a battle, even in this crazy situation.
Are there any more strong opponents?
Let the chaos come. I shall rampage again.
Ahh... let's... have some more FUN
Need a hero? look no further.
Are you ready? BEAT UP.
Heh heh. Who wants to enter the traction next?
Hey! Wrestling is real!
Fair warning... I'm registered as a lethal weapon.
Don't worry, nobody will think any of this nonsense is canon.
Tonight I dine on tank!
Whoa, that's a weird look. Are you an anime character?
So...it is a devil world.
...You cannot have my pudding.
After waiting so long, it feels good to do more than two moves!
That's not how you use chopsticks, buddy.
In fighting, concentration is....uh...hmm...gee, I forgot.
Absolute Karate. That's Kyokugen. And don't forget it, dweebenheimer!
I suppose your only redeeming quality is the fact that you don't die when killed.
I read your moves like the funny papers!
I awake from 100 years of sleep to kick some butt!
